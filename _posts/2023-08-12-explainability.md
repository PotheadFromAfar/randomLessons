# Explainability

What if explainability is not the whole issue but it becomes in pissing contests or in "debunking".

What if the practical one could incresingly become the experiential one?

Then I could I have issues with decomposing and having semantic trees like a machine learning model does, or graphs. Or have issues with application of concepts.

What if then the issue becomes information sharing, then it binds again to "understandable explanation" and it might come in 300 sauces.

Some people might find the articulate scientific explanation as a fuckery, some might find the creative one with slide shows over dogs or cats a gigantic pile of shit.

At the end might seriously be, whatever works but if you're in a pissing contest, take the balls out.
